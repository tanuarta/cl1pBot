# cl1pBot

A discord bot for my personal use that will automatically upload any clips to a youtube channel or google drive.

Currently using https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload to interact with youtube's API but will use my own script in the future to customise to my needs.

Currently using Google.py from https://learndataanalysis.org/google-drive-api-in-python-getting-started-lesson-1/ to help authentication with Goodle Drive api v3.

Dependencies:

```pip3 install discord```

```sudo pip3 --upgrade google-api-python-client oauth2client progressbar2 google-auth-oauthlib```
